# mpc-cbf-ackerman-python
This repo is python version &amp;&amp; ackerman version for mpc_cbf
Using the two-wheeled bicycle kinematic model, considering oneself as a point mass.
In fact, the volume of the vehicle itself can be taken into account by increasing the inflation radius of the obstacles.

## P.S.
if anybody need more development of this repo, please tell me.
I will enrich the content of this repo, welcome star.

Here is my question:

When using the Ackermann kinematic model and setting the parameter gamma to an extreme value, the problem may become unsolvable.
Is this due to the nonlinearity of the kinematics?

If anbody knows, please tell me.
